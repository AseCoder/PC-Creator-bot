,help is made of pages. one category per pages
each page contains the category name and all commands with all their info
if page is too long, the category should be split into multiple pages, named " - Page X/Y"
	render text, one command at a time
	if text exceeds 2048 chars, start a new page
		"start a new page" -> the commands that fit into page X, foreach command.page = X
		scrap the rendered text
		start rendering the next page with the commands that have not been assigned page


create empty string
currentPage = 0
while commands left in this category that have not been assigned to a page
	command = commands left in category [0] or .first()
	if string + command and its info is longer than 2048 {
		string = command and its info // aka start a new page
		currentPage++
	} else {
		add command and its info to string
	}
	assign page number to command (command.page = currentPage)
	iterate to next command

,help
-> send them the first categorys page 1
well what the fuck is the first categorys page 1 and how the fuck does one define it
	iterate through unhidden commands
	REMEMBER THE GODDAMN EXCPTIONS FOR MISC CATEGORY
